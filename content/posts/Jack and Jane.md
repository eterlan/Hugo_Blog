### some thinking...before the writing
  - no bad guys, think they have to do that. why you have to do that? robbory?killing is too much. why you have to do that? all about crime? something not allowed? illegel? thief. that's bit better. what ? all crime? what about not moral ? that's a lot better. why it always havr to be wrong? what about some unfortunate? or good=>bad=>good? something has to be turned. what ? is it has to be conflict? mightbe .

### Synponosis of Jack and Jane 
  - In China ,there is a a beloved couple. Jack and Jane, they know each other through their parents, neighbourhood, known well each other. 
  - At first everything just go fine, they go bali island for honeymoon and has a really good time. Jack is a handsome and susscessful bussiness man, he appreciate that kind of traditional woman who has some knowledge and most important point is reliance - Jane is, at the first glance he knows that girl is his dream girl.
  - They came back and live together. Then Jack found something wrong. Jane is that Jane, traditional, knowledge, pretty accent, at the same time she is unbelieveable shuojiaode. she's talktive especially when she show her knowledge, in Jack's view, it's totally show off and also insulting!
  - You know, Jack is a leader, a Boss, he definitely hate this. I'm not a barchild you taught, he thought.
  - Jane doesn't has a good time either. Jack is a nice husbend, rich and handsome, easy to go with. It's no way to pick any disxxx of him. If you really want to pick one, maybe it's his reading habbit . He love those HOWTOSUCCESS books. he's not so busy in his company, which Jane knows clearly. He just read those books one by one, even at bed time. In Jane's mind, those are just gubbish and totally worthless. She thought, you are successful, wealthy, why you still purchase it ?
  - Times pass, things worse.They don't actually argue everyday, not even show their discomfort on face, they just doing their own stuff without a word. 
  - 3 months, they divorce, without heart-break and all in a peace. Although their parents and relatives, college all show their uncomprehension and pity for it, Jack and Jane know, live alone, without tolerate with each other, they are now happy now.
  - After all, most of those who show pitys don't has a resonance family,then, why should we live with other guy regardless the hormone's plot which has a sacred name love?

### Setting
  - 1. bali island
    - There are a beloved couple play on the beach, 
  - 2. living room.
    - Jack sit in a big confortable sofa reading his books. Jane do with her homework, preparing for lessons on tomorrow morning .Only the tireless clock click-click on the wall.
  - 3. after divorce
    - two pic combine to one.l eft is Jane, right is Jack, a path to the different side. A few people around them show their pity.

### some context
  - It's totally run away from the initial bankrupt plot for the reason I think it's cliche and boring also inconvincible.
  - When the professors teaching thses technic(yes I have already taught how to write creatively before), I was wondering, is this really should added? These hero, protagonist - we called itenemies, conflict, and finally solution, is everything we have to put in the writing? I really chewed upon it for long time, before taking this class, actually is when I thought what makes a good game. And finally I found the answer might be no, partly. admittly, There are a lots of defeating game about how to defeat enemies, how to craft weapon, improve combat skills.However, there are also many great game e.g. for examples, like EdithFinch, To the moon. Beyond the concept that bad guys all think they have reasonable and compelling reason to do a crime, do we really need a bad guy in our story? For my view, I'm tired of Hollywood-Super-Hero movies and Killing-Shooting that kind of stuffs. Maybe it's about age, maybe just my issue, but I know there are plenty of player also tired of these. That's the reason why I write this tiny story.
  - By the way, I'm not showing disrespect to the professor. He is nice, his techinic about how to write, it really helps me write something, think deeper, and delve into the writing, I appreciate that.
