# World Design for Video Game - Week 1

*Knowing what you like is a good thing. The point of this reflective assignment is to isolate and analyze the aspects of a game world that keep you playing and interested in the game.*

To begin, pick one game (not a game series–just one game!) you feel strongly about. Use the title of the game as your project title. To help your peers, please include a reference URL to your game–a Wiki, an image, or the game itself.

Then, please answer the following three questions:

1. Describe your game. Why do you find the game compelling?
2. What defines your world? Tell your peers what makes your game world unique.
3. How does the environment of the game affect the game play?

### Review criterialess 

- Did you upload all the required components of the assignment (reference link to game and three responses)? (4 pts)
- Did you define at least one property of your game world? (2 pts)
- Did you identify how the environment of the game affects the game play? (2 pts)

### Tips for Completionless 

For the question that asks why do you find the game compelling, ask yourself:

- Why do you like to play in this world?
- Do you like being in that world?
- What is it you find appealing or fun about this world? Is it the visuals, the story, the characters, or something else?

To define your world, use any of these prompts to craft your answer:

- Is your world constrained with boundaries (ie. with walls or fences) or does it infinitely expand?
- Does the game world resemble a real-life environment or is it completely constructed?
- If your world is completely unique what defines it? Think technology, culture, society, religion, etc…
- If it resembles reality, is it contemporary or historical?

# The Last of Us

[The Last of Us - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us)

### Why do you find the game compelling?

There are many games impressed me, each one is respectful and honorable, such us This War of Mine, The Legend of Sword and Fairy 4, Heroes of Might and Magic Online 3, Steins;Gate, What Remains of Edith Finch, and so on. However, if you want me to choose the best one, I would say it's The Last of Us. As you know, there are many survive in apocalyptic world game which full of zombies and the only goal is to keep yourself alive. And that's the greatness point of The Last of Us. It focus on the humanity and the relationship between survivors in endworld which is an unfamiliar experience for most of us - living in safe world, repeat mundane daily life, not need to worry about food or zombies, and, which is most important, we are detached from each other. To relie and take responsible for each other, conquering each difficulties in this world, is what The Last of Us wants each player to experience.

### What defines your world? Tell your peers what makes your game world unique.

Three main forces in this destructed world, Fireflies, a rebel militia, quarantine zone authorities, and zombies everywhere outside the quarantine zones.

### How does the environment of the game affect the game play?

Civilization is destroyed by the infection. Survivors live in the quarantine zones, restrict by the authorities. It's hard to do anything outside but they protagonist have to make it. Ellie is bite by zombie but not infected, which miracle make her the savior for human. Actually Joel, controlled by player, is the protector of Ellie, so the savior would be both of them. After all that happen, the name of this game reveals it's meaning, truly striking.
